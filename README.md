## Tech task 'Journal Section component'

This project was created by [Katya Horton](https://github.com/KatyaHorton) with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and 3rd party files.  

### Start the project: 

**1.** Download the [Journal-section-task repository](https://github.com/KatyaHorton/Journal-section-task)

**2.** Check out from the file's directory

**3.**  Instal Node Package Manager by running:

**4.**  Start the app by running: 

```

```

### Walk-through project creating proses:

**1.** Create React App

git remote add origin https://github.com/KatyaHorton/Journal-section-task
git push -u origin master
``` 

**2.** Add customised files from the 3rd party to the project.
